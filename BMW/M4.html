						<p>The BMW M4 is a high-performance version of the BMW 4 Series automobile developed by BMW's motorsport division, the BMW M GmbH. Part of the renumbering that splits the 3 Series coupe and convertible models to the 4 Series (to further differentiate it from the 3 Series), the M4 replaced the M3 Coupe and Convertible models. Upgrades over the standard BMW 4-Series include: a very powerful and responsive, twin turbocharged engine; improved handling, suspension, and braking systems; aerodynamic body enhancements; interior/exterior accents with the tri-colour "M" (Motorsport) badging; the significantly reduced weight compared to the standard 4 series and its predecessor with an all-new stiffer chassis and extensive use of carbon fiber, especially the roof of the car.</p>
					</br>
					
					<h4 class="title", id="new"><strong>F82 M4</strong></h4>
					</br>
						<p>On September 25, 2013, BMW released technical specifications of the M4 powered by a M-tuned S55B30 engine. Although it is a 3.0 liter inline engine, BMW states that it is completely different to the N55 engine seen in other BMW 335i models and this engine has been built specifically for the new M4/M3, displacing 3.0 L (180 cu in) and redlining at 7,500 rpm. The rev limiter coming in at 7,600 rpm. The engine uses two mono-scroll turbochargers with boost peaking at 18.1 psi (1 bar). The power is rated at 425 hp (317 kW; 431 PS) while torque will be 550 N⋅m (410 lb⋅ft). The weight of the 6 speed manual M4 is 1,572 kg (3,466 lb), with the M-DCT some 40 kg (88 lb) heavier, losing some 80 kg (176 lb) from the E92 BMW M3.[1] Both 6-speed manual and 7-speed M-DCT transmissions are available. The 7-speed M-DCT transmission accelerates the car from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.1 seconds). The 6-speed manual transmission does 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.3 seconds).</p>
						<p>Carbon fiber reinforced plastic is used extensively throughout the car, including drive shaft, roof, roof bow, trunk, and front strut brace. For the first time in the M vehicle, an electric power steering unit is being used. The steering system is specifically tuned for the M3 and M4. The 18 inches (460 mm) and 19 inches (480 mm) wheel options are available with lightweight forged alloys being standard. The M compound brakes come standard (in blue), while carbon ceramic brakes (in gold) are available as an option.</p>
						<p>The M4 features Active Sound. A live amplification of the engine's natural sound was inducted into the passenger cabin via the speakers. BMW says this technology has been used so that the well insulated cabin can reduce road/wind noise but still provide the driver with the sporty sound of the M powered engine. There are no artificial sound or any pre-recorded track.</p>
						<p>he M4 is based on the F32 4 Series[3] however 50 percent of its components are unique compared to the 4 Series.</p>
					</br>
					
					<h4 class="title", id="new"><strong>F83 M4</strong></h4>
					</br>
						<p>The convertible was announced along with its coupe sibling. It shares almost everything with the coupe version, but weighs more due to its retractable hardtop. The convertible weighs 1,750 kilograms (3,858 lb) (manual), 60 kilograms (132 lb) less than its predecessor. The three-piece retractable hardtop folds in 20 seconds.</p>
						<p>Because of its extra weight it accelerates slower, taking it 0.3s longer to 100 km/h (62 mph), 4.6s with the manual and 4.3s with the M-DCT transmission.</p>
					</br>
					
					<h4 class="title", id="new"><strong>F82/F83 Competition Package</strong></h4>
					</br>
						<p>During February 2016, BMW announced the M3/M4 Competition Package. With this package, the M4 boasts 444 horsepower and a revised suspension for better handling. New springs, dampers and anti-roll bars complement the included Adaptive M Suspension. BMW also re-tuned the electronic differential and the Dynamic Stability Control to match the upgraded hardware. The interior remains largely unchanged, but Competition Package cars get new lightweight sport seats along with the M-striped woven seat belts. The exterior include the M Sport exhaust with black chrome tailpipes and high gloss Shadow Line exterior trim. Gloss black trim are added to the kidney grille, side gills, and model badge on the trunk.</p>
						<p>With the competition package the Coupe version goes from standstill to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.0s, while the convertible version does the run in 4.2s, both using the dual clutch transmission.</p>
						<p>The Competition package costs $4,750 for the M3/M4 and $4,250 for the M4 convertible on top of its base price.</p>
					</br>
					
					<h4 class="title", id="new"><strong>FF82 M4 GTS</strong></h4>
					</br>
						<p>BMW introduced the M4 GTS concept in August 2015 at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.[7] In 2016, BMW released track-focused version of the standard M4 coupe and will be limited to 700 units with price tag of $133,205. It is powered by the same 3.0-litre twin-turbo straight-six engine as in the normal M4, but the power has been raised to 500 PS (368 kW; 493 bhp), largely due to a novel water injection system that is the first to be used on a production automobile in almost twenty years. In addition to the increased engine power, the M4 GTS is 27 kg (60 lb) lighter than the standard M4 Coupé with the DCT transmission, so the weight now stands at 1,585 kg (3,494 lb). The 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) is reduced to just 3.8 seconds, while the top speed is 305 km/h (190 mph). The M4 GTS has, according to BMW, lapped the Nürburgring Nordschleife in 7min 28sec, 24 seconds faster than the base M4, 20 seconds faster than the M3 GTS and the same time as a Porsche Carrera GT.</p>
					</br>
					
					<h4 class="title", id="new"><strong>F82 M4 CS</strong></h4>
					</br>
						<p>In Spring 2017, BMW announced M4 CS in limited run of only 3000 units globally. BMW M4 CS sits between M4 Competition Package and M4 GTS and produces 454 hp and 442 lb-ft of torque with price tag of $97,400.</p>
